# Introduction
Multi-scale cell fit networks are a fascinating area of research that explores the intricate connections between different scales of biological systems. At the cell level, these networks examine the complex interactions between cells and their environment, while at the self-cell communication level, they delve into the intricate signaling pathways that allow cells to communicate with one another. These networks also explore the distribution of signals and the continuous dynamical systems that can occur within a single cell. All of these fascinating phenomena can be explored and analyzed using QMD files, making multi-scale cell fit networks an exciting and promising area of research for scientists and researchers alike.
