#= 
declare type hierachy of a toy pharma model:
 - pharma model (represented by a FreeAgent),
 - therapeutic area (represented by a FreeAgent), 
 - molecules (small, large - to demonstrate dynamic dispatch)
   alternatively, marketed drugs; a drug may drop out from the system,
 - discovery unit (per therapeutic area)
   generates new molecules according to a Poisson counting process
 - market demand
   this will be represented by a stochastic differential equation implemented in DifferentialEquations.jl
